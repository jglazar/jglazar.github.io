I am a PhD candidate and [National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate
Fellow](https://ndseg.org/about) studying computational biophysics at Penn. 

My dissertation work with [Prof. Vivek Shenoy](https://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu)
focuses on üß¨ DNA architecture. I developed [üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ GENTLEChrO](/dissertation/)
to model DNA's hierarchical spatial structure. I wrote the code in C++, with 
Python for data analysis.

Earlier in my PhD, I studied the [‚ö°Ô∏è electronic structure of 2D
materials](/projects/mx_project) and [üìä applied machine
learning](/projects/mp_project) to guide materials searches.

I ‚ù§Ô∏è  to use coding to [teach others](/teaching/) about math and science. 

After my PhD, I want to find a role in quantitative finance. Check out my
[projects](/projects/) page for writeups on analyzing ticket data, creating
trading strategies, and winning a stock pitch competition.
