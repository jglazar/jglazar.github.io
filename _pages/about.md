I am a quant researcher at [Trexquant](https://trexquant.com) building AI
research tools using LLMs ü§ñ. I also use LLMs to study earnings calls ‚òéÔ∏è  and
company news üì∞.

Before, I was a PhD student and [National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate
Fellow](https://ndseg.org/about) studying computational biophysics at Penn. 

I ‚ù§Ô∏è  to use coding to [teach others](/teaching/) about math and science. My
[free notes online](https://github.com/jglazar/notes/tree/main) have over 50
