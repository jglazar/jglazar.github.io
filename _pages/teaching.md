I ‚ù§Ô∏è  teaching math and science, especially using code.

I have served as a teaching assistant, tutor, and volunteer at Penn and Stony
Brook.

I most recently served as a TA for the `Machine Learning for Materials Science`
class, for which I wrote and presented **[üìî this Python
notebook][RandomForest]** to explain the Random Forest algorithm.

In Summer 2020 I served as the TA for an accelerated summer session of `Atomic
Modeling in Materials Science`, where I wrote **[üé¢ physics
simulations][MSE561]** in Python, troubleshooted student code, and met
one-on-one with students to clarify computational physics concepts.

At Stony Brook, I worked Tuesday and Thursday nights as a [Residential
Tutor][ResidentTutor] for Calculus I/II, Physics I/II, and
Probability/Statistics. I also volunteered in the Physics Help Room, where I was
the only undergrad to teach error analysis, kinematics, electricity and
magnetism, and other introductory physics topics. 

I've had the privilege to volunteer at a number of K-12 events including: 
  * Penn's [Activities for Community Engagement in Science][ACES] (ACES)
    chemistry day
  * Penn's [Moelis Access Science][MAS] tutor program with West Philadelphia HS
  * Smithtown NY Science Night
  * [Stony Brook Science Olympiad][SciOly]

All of these experiences have shaped me as a scientist, communicator, and teacher.
I am especially thankful for the kind people who run these programs
and for all my students for being curious, enthusiastic, and open-minded!
