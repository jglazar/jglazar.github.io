A few weeks ago, I scraped the StubHub website for World Series ticket prices during the 2022 World Series in Philadelphia. 
It was an exciting time here in Philly, and prices skyrocketed due to high demand. This data project explores ticket prices over time, 
specifically exploring the similarities between ticket prices and options in the stock market.
