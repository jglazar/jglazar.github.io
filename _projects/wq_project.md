From late March through summer 2023, [WorldQuant](https://www.worldquant.com) is
running its annual [International Quant
Championship](https://www.worldquant.com/brain/iqc/).

The competition runs on WorldQuant's [üß† BRAIN
platform](https://www.worldquant.com/brain/), which hosts over 85,000 data
types, hundreds of operator functions, and a custom backtesting simulator to
test alpha ideas.

I'm happy to share that I placed 382/29,101 in the world (top 1.3%) and 20/1,191
(top 1.7%) in the USA during the 1st round. I placed 315/2,920 in the world (top
11%) and 12/100 in the USA for the 2nd round. The third round took the best
candidates from each region, so unfortunately I did not qualify to advance. Go
team USA üá∫üá∏!

## Competition rules

This competition involves building alphas: functions which assign weights to
each stock in a given universe, dictating how much stock to buy each day as part
of a portfolio. Alphas specify how to reweights stocks each day using the
specific data streams. The WorldQuant Brain platform simulates the appropriate
financial transactions taken to achieve that portfolio. Alphas that produce the
highest and most stable returns receive high scores.

Contestants generate alphas using operators to process historical stock data
like price, volume, revenue, options prices, and news coverage. These operators
and data can be combined in exponentially many ways, opening the door for
creativity and uniqueness.

Alphas are individually scored with a secret formula that weights their Sharpe
ratio, turnover, and a custom metric named "fitness." Fitness is calculated as
`sqrt(abs(Returns) / max(turnover,0.125)) * Sharpe`. This rewards alphas with
a high Sharpe ratio and high returns with low turnover (a penalty for wildly
varying day-to-day weights). 

Scores from each submitted alpha are aggregated such that baskets of alphas with
strong and uncorrelated returns are highly rewarded. All scores are based on a
5-year backtest ranging from 2016 to 2021.

Each round pares down the field to fewer and fewer contestants. The first round
hosted over 29,000 participants. Cutoffs for the second round eliminated all but
the top 100 contestants from each region. The third round pits the best
contestants from each region against one another. Then, final round is an
in-person competition with cash prizes from a $100k pool üí∞!

## Generating alphas

WorldQuant generously hosted Q and A sessions with current quant researchers. I
got the chance to interact with researchers from India, Korea, and China as they
taught about topics from alpha neutralization (unbiasing alphas across different
industries or sectors) to vector data fields (which provide more than 1 data
point per day). 

These webinars were the source of countless alpha ideas and tactics to improve performance. 
My [üìù webinar notes][webinar] list out the alphas and tips shared by the researchers, as well as the 
answers to some of the questions asked by myself and the other participants.

I found WorldQuant's articles to be fantastic sources of new ideas. My
[üìù article notes][ideas] show hundreds of the alphas I tested. For example, I
tried *every single one* of the [üìà 101 formulaic alphas](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.00991.pdf). 
It took me over an hour, but I managed to find a few worth submitting!

## A few alphas

Overall, I tested 1,103 alphas and submitted the 28 best for scoring. These
involved data fields comprising price, volume, fundamental, and news information
on stocks from the USA and China.

Alphas specify data, functions, and testing parameters. One especially important
testing parameter is the neutralization, which allows for group-neutral
portfolio construction. For example, market neutralization zeros-out our 
portfolio such that there is an equal weight of long and short positions across
the market. This allows betting not on the overall momentum of the market,
but rather the relative movements of stocks within the market. Other group
neutralizations like sector, industry, and subindustry neutralization are
possible too.

For more information about data, operators, and testing parameters, check out
the WorldQuant Brain platform's excellent [üìë documentation][braindocs].

You can check out all of my [üìà submitted alphas][alphas] in my notes on GitHub.
Below are a few of my favorites. The graphs show the alpha's profit on a $10M
portfolio over a 5-year backtest from 2016 to 2021

(1) Simple price reversion
```
(high + low)/2 - close
```
  * Parameters -- Top 3000 stocks, market neutralization
  * Idea -- This is a super simple mean reversion idea! If the price went down
    at the end of the day compared to the average price, then buy the stock
    tomorrow.
  * Performance -- 1.80 Sharpe, 51% Turnover, 17% Annual Returns, 1.03 Fitness
  * Notes -- This alpha performs surprisingly well given its simple form. It has
    a high Sharpe ratio and annual return, but its sensitivity on day-to-day
    changes lead to a high turnover rate too.

(2) Complicated price reversion
```
rel_days_since_max = rank(ts_arg_max(close, 30));
decline_pct = (vwap - close) / close;
decline_pct / min( ts_decay_linear(rel_days_since_max, 1), 0.15)
```
  * Parameters -- Top 200 stocks, market neutralization
  * Idea -- Focus the simple price reversion strategy on stocks which have
    recently peaked. Note that `vwap` is the volume-weighted average price, a
    more accurate measure of the average price. I used percentages to more
    fairly compare stocks and clamped the denominator at 0.15 to avoid
    overweighting just a few stocks.
  * Performance -- 1.58 Sharpe, 49% Turnover, 23% Annual Returns, 1.09 Fitness
  * Notes -- We were able to boost annual returns even further by adding time
    data to the mix. Unfortunately, this didn't decrease turnover though.

(3) Short overpriced companies
```
-ts_zscore(enterprise_value/ebitda, 63)
```
  * Parameters -- Top 3000 stocks, industry neutralization
  * Idea -- Short stocks with rising valuations above their earnings, compares
    to others within their industry. I rank the companies with a 63-day (single
    quarter) lookback to account for the most recent and prior reports.
  * Performance -- 2.00 Sharpe, 25% Turnover, 10% Annual Returns, 1.26 Fitness
  * Notes -- Finally, an alpha with lower turnover! This is due to the much
    more stable nature of fundamental data (which only changes quarterly)
    compared to price-volume data (which changes daily). Interestingly, testing
    a version with faster updated data earns a 2.58 Sharpe with 1.70 Fitness!
    This indicates that analyzing earnings reports as soon as they release can
    significantly improve a fundamental-based strategy.

(4) Hot news with reversion
```
avg_news = vec_avg(nws12_afterhsz_sl);
rank(ts_sum(avg_news, 60)) > 0.5 ? 1 : rank(-ts_delta(close, 2))
```
  * Parameters -- Top 3000 stocks, subindustry neutralization
  * Idea -- Buy stocks that are relatively newsworthy compared to peers within
    their subindustry. For the less newsworthy stocks, use a simple price
    reversion strategy. This mixes momentum (based on news) with reversion.
  * Performance -- 1.84 Sharpe, 9% Turnover, 4.29% Annual Returns, 1.08 Fitness 
  * Notes -- This alpha performed especially well at the beginning of COVID,
    around March 2020. Perhaps the relationship between news and stock prices
    changed around then, coinciding with the newfound importance of trends in
    remote work, pharmaceuticals, and at-home entertainment.

(5) Too much buzz is bad
```
buzz = ts_backfill(-vec_sum(scl12_alltype_buzzvec), 20);
ts_av_diff(buzz, 60)
```
  * Parameters -- Top 3000 stocks, subindustry neutralization
  * Idea -- Short stocks that have increasing buzz compared to their average
    over the last 60 days.
  * Performance -- 1.94 Sharpe, 45% Turnover, 22% Annual Returns, 1.35 Fitness
  * Notes -- Similar to the prior alpha, this one performed especially well
    starting around March 2020. The social media buzz complements the news data,
    providing sufficiently uncorrelated returns to increase my overall score.

Overall, I found that price reversion strategies worked especially well for this
competition. All of the above alphas incorporated some form of price reversion,
either directly in alphas 1 and 2 or as part of a larger strategy in alpha 4.
Reversion also appears in alpha 5 as a signal within social media buzz data.

In addition to price reversion, I also found success in leveraging the COVID
pandemic's effects on the market. Many alphas that performed OK pre-COVID
shot to the moon üöÄ starting around March 2020. COVID clearly kicked off a new
wave of trading activity that rewarded alphas based on news and social media
buzz. Alphas like 4 and 5 performed especially well starting around 2020.

## Conclusion

üéâ After months of researching and testing alphas, attending seminars, and
reading articles, I am happy to have finished the 2nd round in the top 15 of the
USA. I'll certainly be following along to cheer on the USA team as it progresses
into the 3rd round!

I had a great time learning about backtesting, alpha generation, and data
exploration from some of the best quant researchers in the world. The tutorials,
seminars, and recommended papers complemented each other well.

I would like to thank WorldQuant again for putting together such a well-run
event and exciting event. I'm looking forward to another competition next
year!
